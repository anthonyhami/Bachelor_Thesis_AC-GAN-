# Bachelor’s Thesis at the Berlin Institute of Health: Application of GANs to generate synthetic DNA methylation datato overcome class imbalance

## Abstract:
The aim of this thesis is to overcome this class imbalance problem by implementing and testing an Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Network (AC-GAN),
a class-aware GAN, that tries to generate realistic synthetic methylation data from lowly represented brain tumour types. This thesis also aims to investigate various AC-GAN architectures on DNA methylation data. Thus, different model architectures were implemented as well as evaluated using various criteria
including generic loss functions and also domain-specific evaluation metrics such as DNA methylation profiles and nearest neighbour statistics. The results of this thesis have shown that the input data affects the outcome of the model. The selection of fewer but more important features can tremendously improve the model performance. Another finding suggests using less complex model architectures, such as the type of layers and number of nodes in each layer that play an essential role with regards to the computational time, memory requirements and model’s performance. It was also recognized that it is not necessary to train the model for a large number of iterations. Based on the promising results, this thesis helps in understanding AC-GAN models and the influence of hyperparameters with the intention of solving the class imbalance problem as well as generating realistic synthetic DNA methylation data.
